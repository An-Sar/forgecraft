ForgeCraft Process

break ore into raw iron chunks 

Crucibles are preheated

Crucible is loaded with raw ore type and supporting minerals (sand, glass etc.)

Crucible is instered into hot Forge

Heat is managed carefully per ore type

when ore specific heat time is reached the crucible is removed from the forge

each ore type has a different curing process.

for example copper can be allowed to cool quickly where-as crucible steel most be cooled slowly

after the crucible has cooled the crucible lid is broken returning the crucible only

the ingot can be of poor, average, or excellent quality
(How can a player test the quality of their ingot?)

The ingot is oreDict compatible

The ingot is heated in an appropriate temperte forge

the heating ingot is placed on an anvil and hammered slowly into shape.

It takes the space of one slot and is slowly formed through hammering into another slot. Taking up both slots in the process.

8 angles total

Every time the ingot shape is changed it will turn into a new block or block state. Until finally it takes the intended shape.

After the intended shape is taken a polishing step is completed

After polishing the steel is heated again and then put into a type cooling solution, water or oil. Poor Ingots have a higher tendency to crack at this point rendering the tool worthless and only capabling of being recast into an ingot.

after the metal is succesfully cooled it can be crafted into its respective weapon or tool.

Probably best to break down how each metal is made and derive shared processes from them.
